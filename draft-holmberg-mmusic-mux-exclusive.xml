        <t>
            This document defines how an endpoint can indicate exclusive support of
            RTP/RTCP multiplexing using the Session Description Protocol (SDP).

        <t>
            The document updates RFC 5761, by defining how the SDP 'rtcp' attribute
            is used, together with the SDP 'rtcp-mux' attribute, to indicate exclusive
            support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing.

    <section title="Introduction">
		<t>
            <xref target="RFC5761" pageno="false" format="default"/> defines how to
            multiplex RTP and RTCP on a single port, referred to as RTP/RTCP multiplexing.
            <xref target="RFC5761" pageno="false" format="default"/> also defines an
            Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4566" pageno="false" 
            format="default"/> attribute, 'rtcp-mux' that can be used by entities
            to indicate support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing.
        </t>
        <t>
            As defined in <xref target="RFC5761" pageno="false" format="default"/>, if
            the peer endpoint does not support RTP/RTCP multiplexing, there must be a
            fallback to usage of separate ports for RTP and RTCP. However, the RTCWEB
            WG have defined that support of the fallback is optional.
            Therefore, there needs to be a mechanism for an endpoint to be able to indicate 
            exclusive support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing, i.e. to be able to indicate that 
            the endpoint only supports RTP/RTCP multiplexing and is not able to fallback
            to usage of separate ports for receiving RTP and RTCP.
        </t>
        <t>
            This document describes a mechanism, how the SDP 'rtcp-mux' attribute
            <xref target="RFC5761" pageno="false" format="default"/> and the SDP 'rtcp' 
            attribute <xref target="RFC3605" pageno="false" format="default"/> can
            be used to indicate exclusive support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing. The document
            updates sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.3 of <xref target="RFC5761" pageno="false" 
            format="default"/> in order to enable usage of the mechanism.
        </t>
        <t>
            The document also describes the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) 
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis"/> considerations when indicating exclusive
            support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing.

                As as described in <xref target="RFC5761" pageno="false"

                to indicate support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing, it must associate
                an SDP 'rtcp-mux' attribute with each RTP-based SDP media
                description ("m=" line) for which support of multiplexing is indicated.
                In addition, the offerer may assign an SDP 'rtcp' attribute, in 
                order to provide a fallback port for RTCP in case the answerer
                does not support (or is not willing to use) RTP/RTCP multiplexing.

                When an offerer sends an offer, and wants to indicate exclusive
                support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing it MUST, in addition to the
                SDP 'rtcp-attribute, associate an SDP 'rtcp' attribute with each
                SDP media description for which exclusive support of RTP/RTCP 
                multiplexing is indicated. The offerer MUST assign a value identical
                to the port value of the associated SDP media description to the
                'rtcp' attribute.

NEW PARAGRAPH:
      
   If the offerer is not able to use different ports
   for RTP and RTCP, the SDP offer MUST also include the "a=rtcp"
   attribute [10] with an attribute value identical to the associated
   port value for RTP. For example:

       v=0

OLD TEXT:

   If it is desired to use both ICE and multiplexed RTP and RTCP, the
   initial offer MUST contain an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute to indicate that
   RTP and RTCP multiplexing is desired and MUST contain "a=candidate:"
   lines for both RTP and RTCP along with an "a=rtcp:" line indicating a
   fallback port for RTCP in the case that the answerer does not support
   RTP and RTCP multiplexing.  This MUST be done for each media where
   RTP and RTCP multiplexing is desired.

            <t>
                ISSUE #1: We may want to specify an explicit procedure for the
                answerer too, saying that it must select mux if it receives
                rtcp-mux and rtcp with the RTP port value.

            <t>
                ISSUE #2: We may want to specify something about the case when
                the answerer only supports mux, and receives an offer without mux.

	<section title="ICE Considerations">
		<t>
            As defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis"/>, if an entity is aware that the 
            remote peer supports, and is willing to use, RTP/RTCP multiplexing,
            the entity will only provide RTP candidates (component ID 1).
            However, only providing RTP candidates does not as such imply
            exclusive support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing. RTCP candidates
            would not be provided also in cases where RTCP is not supported
            at all. Therefore, additional information is needed in order
            to indicate support of exclusive RTP/RTCP multiplexing. This
            document defines such mechanism using the SDP 'rtcp-mux' and 'rtcp'
            attributes.
