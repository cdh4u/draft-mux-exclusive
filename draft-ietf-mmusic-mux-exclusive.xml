            This document defines a new SDP media-level attribute, 'rtcp-mux-only', that can
            be used by an endpoint to indicate exclusive support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing. The
            document also updates RFC 5761, by clarifying that an offerer can use a mechanism
            to indicate that it is not able to send and receive RTCP on separate ports.

            <xref target="RFC5761" pageno="false" format="default"/> defines how to
            multiplex RTP and RTCP on a single IP address and port, referred to as RTP/RTCP multiplexing.
            <xref target="RFC5761" pageno="false" format="default"/> also defines an
            Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4566" pageno="false"
            format="default"/> attribute, 'rtcp-mux' that can be used by entities
            to indicate support, and negotiate usage of, RTP/RTCP multiplexing.
        </t>
        <t>
            As defined in <xref target="RFC5761" pageno="false" format="default"/>, if
            the peer endpoint does not support RTP/RTCP multiplexing, both endpoints should
            use separate ports for sending and receiving of RTCP (referred to as fallback
            to usage of separate ports for RTP and RTCP).
        </t>
        <t>
            Some newer applications that do not require backward compatibility with peers
            that cannot multiplex RTCP might choose to not implement separation of
            RTP and RTCP. For those applications, this document defines an SDP attribute
            to signal intent to require multiplexing.

            In an SDP offer, the offerer uses the SDP 'rtcp-mux-only' attribute to
            indicate exclusive support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing for the RTP-based
            media associated with the SDP media description ("m=" line).

        <t>
            In an SDP answer, the 'rtcp-mux-only' attribute indicates that the answerer
            supports, and accepts usage of, RTP/RTCP multiplexing for the RTP-based media
            associated with the SDP media description ("m=" line).

            The mux category <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes"/>

            attribute, if used within a BUNDLE group <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation"/>,
            must be associated with all multiplexed RTP-based media descriptions

        <t>
            The 'rtcp-mux-only' attribute applies to the whole associated

                This section updates sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.3 of RFC 5761, by clarifying
                that an offerer can use a mechanism to indicate that it is not able to send and receive RTCP
                on separate ports, and that the offerer shall terminate the affected streams if the answerer

                an SDP 'candidate' attribute for RTCP, nor will the offerer provide a fallback port for RTCP

	<section title="ICE Considerations">
		<t>
            As defined in <xref target="RFC5245"/>, if an entity is aware that the
            remote peer supports, and is willing to use, RTP/RTCP multiplexing,
            the entity will only provide RTP candidates (component ID 1).
            However, only providing RTP candidates does not as such imply
            exclusive support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing. RTCP candidates
            would not be provided also in cases where RTCP is not supported
            at all. Therefore, additional information is needed in order
            to indicate support of exclusive RTP/RTCP multiplexing. This
            document defines such mechanism using the SDP 'rtcp-mux-only'
